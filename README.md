# TelegramAPI

## Overview

This implementation is only for building a Telegram bot to send and receive messages. You can expand upon this by adding more features and commands as needed.

## Features

- Send messages
- Receive messages
- That's all I guess :3

## Future Enhancements

I plan to add more features to this bot in the future.
Now I just don't need anything else.
